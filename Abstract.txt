Title
Denoising Dynamic Gene Regulatory Networks with Graph Regularized Dimension Reduction

Abstract
Modeling the complexity of gene regulation and expression proves challenging due to the
complexity and diversity of contexts and mechanisms. We suggest that for some gene reg-
ulatory processes, it might be more adequate to infer different causal graphs for different
time points instead of the static approach of current GRN inference models. To implement
this idea, we employ principle component analysis (PCA) and canonical polyadic (CP) de-
composition schemes combined with graph regularization to inform adjacent time points.
Our approach allows capturing changes over time while still incorporating knowledge from
neighbouring time points, that are assumed to be similar. Our work comprises the follow-
ing experiments: Firstly, comparing PCA and CP with graph regularization on a simple
denoising task. Secondly, testing it on simulated data from different synthetic regulatory
networks. Thirdly, performing a stability analysis, with respect to the number of cells
used for inference, on a real-world data set. While we conclude that further evaluation of
our approach is needed, we believe that we have established a promising starting point.
